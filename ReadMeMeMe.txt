Hello All,

	Thanks for downloading Aqua Button ! Don't you just love the guys over at Apple ? They have the most creative user interface design ever ! Should check out the Aqua interface of MAC OS X .... sweet. Anyway, I made this button cause I've not seen any interface objects from MAC OSX yet on PSC ... this is the first of the Aqua Control Suite that I will be doing :) I really hope you guys like it !!
